# Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals Java Programming: Build a Recommendation System
It is the fifth course of this series, the capstone project.
This is the Website for the Recommendation System: http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/capstone/recommender.php?id=ywvOEbSJo9aFU1
About this course: Ever wonder how Netflix decides what movies to recommend for you? Or how Amazon recommends books? We can get a feel for how it works by building a simplified recommender of our own!

In this capstone, you will show off your problem solving and Java programming skills by creating recommender systems. You will work with data for movies, including ratings, but the principles involved can easily be adapted to books, restaurants, and more. You will write a program to answer questions about the data, including which items should be recommended to a user based on their ratings of several movies. Given input files on users ratings and movie titles, you will be able to:

1. Read in and parse data into lists and maps;
2. Calculate average ratings;
3. Calculate how similar a given rater is to another user based on ratings; and
4. Recommend movies to a given user based on ratings. 
5. Display recommended movies for a given user on a webpage.

Who is this class for: This course is for anyone who has passed the first four courses in the Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals Specialization, who has the ability to program in Java and design algorithms. Bring together everything youâ€™ve learned to make a movie recommendation system that you can put on the web and send to your colleagues and friends!
